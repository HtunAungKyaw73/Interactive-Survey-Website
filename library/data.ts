        description: "People impacted by climate disasters like floods had few sources of support. They depended on local, ad hoc disaster relief groups for assistance; however, in some areas, no help was available. In other locations, civil society organizations (CSOs) provided aid. The SAC’s Relief teams’ efforts were few and far between. The capability of public administrations under the NUG was also limited.",
